# Can be overridden per device / function

# Command to be executed when page of given type
# is received. The type is chosen physically
# on the scanner just before the scanning. If
# no hook is specified for given type, the type
# is considered unsupported by the driver and
# won't be accesible on the scanner front panel.
# Note that scanned images don't differ between
# types. It's only that command that makes a
# difference. Given command will be executed
# with ip of the scanner and a path to the just
# scanned image as two additional arguments.
#
# Currently 4 types are available:
#scan.func IMAGE ./scanhook.sh
#scan.func OCR ./otherhook.sh second_arg third_arg
#scan.func EMAIL ./scanhook.sh
scan.func FILE ./scanhook.sh text

# Optional PIN that will have to be given on
# the scanner panel before scanning any document
# series. Must be exactly 4 digits, otherwise
# password won't be set.

# Max number of seconds for receiving a single
# network message. After this time, the scanning
# session will be terminated.
# Values less than 2 are discouraged.

# Maximum time for receiving the page scan init
# message. Some scanners might need extra time to
# prepare for scanning.
# Values less than 15 are discouraged.

# Maximum time for receiving the page scan finish
# message. Some scanners might need extra time to
# finalize sending page data.
